    <h2>Terms and Definitions</h2>
    <p>For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in SMPTE Standards Operation Manual apply.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="sec-general">
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>Engineering Documents shall conform to ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 and ISO 80000 (all parts), with the following
      exceptions, which shall take precedence:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>variances specified in Clause 6; and</li>
      <li>variances granted by the Director of Engineering or the Standards Vice President for a given
        Engineering Document.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the event of a conflict with the provisions of ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, the SMPTE Standards Operations
      Manual
      and Administrative Guidelines shall take precedence.</p>

    <p class="note">
      The Director of Engineering or the Standards Vice President can approve variances on a case-by-case basis.
      Modifying
      variances specified in this Administrative Guideline requires the approval of the Standards Committee.
    </p>
  </section>


  <section id="sec-general">
    <h2>Templates</h2>
    <p>An Engineering Document shall use an appropriate template specified in SMPTE AG-04, unless:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>it is part of a multipart set of documents, in which case it may alternatively use the same structure and
        formatting
        as other members of the set; or</li>
      <li>it is a Revision, in which case it may alternatively use the same structure and formatting as the current
        edition of \
        the Engineering Document.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The contents of an Amendment shall follow the structure and formatting of the amended document.</p>

    <p class="note">
      Modifying the structure and formatting of a document can change the numbering of elements, potentially
      invalidating references
      made to the document by other documents, published papers and books.
